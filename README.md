# Мари́

> Photography portfolio for Maria written in React (with Redux, Keo) using Babel to transpile to ES5.

## Getting Started

After you have [cloned](git@github.com:Wildhoney/Maria.git) the repository you'll need to install dependencies with `npm i` and then build the project using `npm run build` &ndash; the Clojure (requires [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/)) server can be started with `npm run start` which &mdash; by default &mdash; binds to port 5000.
